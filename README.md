#In the ever-evolving digital world, deepfakes are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pose serious threats across various industries. To address this, I worked on developing an **Audio Deepfake Detection Tool** that can classify audio files as **genuine or deepfake** with remarkable accuracy! 🚀  

🔗 **Key Features:**  
- Extracts **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** features for audio analysis.  
- Leverages **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for reliable classification.  
- User-friendly **Streamlit interface** for seamless interaction.  
- Designed to help protect individuals and organizations from the growing risk of manipulated audio content.  

🎯 **How It Works:**  
1️⃣ Upload a `.wav` audio file for analysis.  
2️⃣ The tool processes the file and extracts key features.  
3️⃣ It classifies the audio as **Genuine** 📈 or **Deepfake** ☠️ using the pre-trained SVM model.  

💡 This project combines the power of **machine learning**, **audio signal processing**, and a **simple yet intuitive UI/UX** to tackle real-world problems.  

✨ **Why This Matters:**  
Deepfake technology is rapidly advancing, but so are our efforts to counteract its misuse. This tool is a step forward in ensuring **digital safety and authenticity** in audio communications.  

Special thanks to **Lenscan.AI** for the inspiration and tools to make this possible. ⚡
